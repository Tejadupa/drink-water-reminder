# drink-water-reminder
The Drinking Water Reminder application is designed to help users stay hydrated throughout the day by providing timely reminders to drink water. This app features a customizable snooze function, allowing users to delay notifications based on their preference, ensuring reminders are not intrusive. The primary alert is delivered through an audible beep sound, which is attention-grabbing yet non-disruptive, making it easy to follow a hydration schedule. With this tool, users are encouraged to maintain optimal water intake for better health and wellness, while the flexible snooze option accommodates different schedules and preferences. The app is particularly useful for individuals who often forget to drink water during busy routines.
